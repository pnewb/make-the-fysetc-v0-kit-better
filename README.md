Things that are great:

* pcb nut bars are tapped.  lightweight and good enough
* fully preconfigured board is _wonderful_ as a build experience
* matte panels and extrusions look great
* wiring literally could not be simpler


Things to change about the kit:

* pre-cut 1.9 ID bowden tube between hotend and extruder
* 3mm ID bowden tube for the reverse bowden
* better screw head on self tapping screws (or at least a cheap philips driver to use them)
* toolhead pcb should have a slotted screw hole to allow backlash adjustment
* toolhead PCB should have a mount/back-plate w/ strain relief
* toolhead PCB cover hits one of the BHCS on the A drive during homing when used with included brass hex standoffs
* proper labels on the microswitches (z and fs)
* part cooling fans seem underpowered
* no way to mount USB & Ethernet panel mounted extensions
* Sensorless homing should back off 5mm
* sensorless homing should have macros to drop current during home and override standard homing procedure (i actually don't know if this is accurate or not...)
* don't ship debug configs
* remove bash history
* start your image creation from a bare image, no desktop components, no random mp4 files scattered around
* should've been a 100mm tophat
* wifi script does not survive reboots, does not edit /etc/network/interfaces
* washers included are washers, not shims
* default config makes motors whine like a child who dropped their ice cream
* cut out at the bottom of toolhead board cover would put less stress on the hotend power wires
* ferrule crimping is bad for bed connections, ferrules into wagos should be square crimps according to wago
* panels are _slightly_ too large
* needs errata documentation for things that are custom about this kit (pinout of toolhead board and catalyst would be nice...can't see catalyst pinout when it's all mounted up)
* fans for a nevermore v6 included in premium kits?
* print start macro is anemic, add KAMP?
* cancel does not remove toolhead from print location and park somewhere safe
* needs filament sensor macros
